In this chapter, Shri Krishna has compared Karmayoga and Karmasanas Yoga that both these routes are the means of reaching the same goal. Therefore, we can choose any of these routes. A intelligent person should continue to perform his worldly duties without dedicating his deeds to God or worrying about his fruit. In this way they remain unaffected by sin and eventually attain liberation.",

          "word_meanings": "Due to lack of knowledge of real devotion due to lack of virtuous saints (Sastiya Yasah), the seeker who attained the sastra -free practice, is specially motivated by the attainment of the Lord and go to the forest, go to the forest or abandon karma and sit in one place and stop the ear nose etc. Adi (f) and (karmayoga:) Shastra is not in vain (Ugo), even while doing spiritual practice, is not in vain, that is, it is not credible and it is not going to do according to the scripture They do not take and those who live at home after getting married are not the only meditation (Nisreyasakrau), but (Tayo), but also both of them (Karmas Ó Yasat) If the work is a thief even after staying as an ashram, that karmasanyas (karmayoga:) Karmayoga According to the scripture while doing worldly deeds, it is best to do spiritual practice (Vishishyate). The same proof is said in the Gita chapter 18 verses 41 to 46 that a person of the four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatri, Vaishya and Shudra) also attain the ultimate Siddhi i.e. complete salvation while doing his natural deeds. It has been clarified about the supreme siddhi in the verse 46 that the divine God from whom all beings have originated from which this whole world is prevalent, the God gets the ultimate Siddhi by worshiping the God by his own natural deeds, that is. The truth seeker receives full salvation while doing karma. Chapter 18 Verse 47 has clarified that according to his scripture (performing karma), the one who performs spiritual practice against Shastra is superior. Because a seeker does not get sin doing his deeds. It also proved that it is a sin to persecute karma by retirement. In Shloka 48, it has been clarified that one should not abandon his natural deeds even if some sins are seen in it. Just as organisms die in cultivation etc. The meaning of 2 is that those who are a seeker against scripture are of two types, one is karma sannyasi, another karma yogi. Both of his types of sadhana, which is not a welfare factor due to lack of philosophy, and both types of scriptures are not going to perform. For example, in the Gita chapter 16 verse 23, it is said that by renouncing the scripture method, arbitrary conduct means worship is meaningless. In Shloka 24, it is said that the scriptures should be considered as proof for the person who does the practice of devotion and for not doing it. In the scriptures (Gita and Vedas), it is said that for complete salvation, search for a philosophy saint. Get the path of devotion with humility. Evidence Gita Chapter 4 Vers 34 A Yajurveda Chapter 40 Mantra 10 and 13 in both of them, Karmasayasi is good with Karmasnayasi, because the Karmayogi who performs the practice without law, when he gets the satsang of a metaphysical saint, he immediately worships against his scripture After abandoning, the scripture gets self -welfare by applying favorable practice. But even while staying at home, both types of hatha yogis, who sit in one place, do not accept the knowledge of the saint by sitting in one place and abandoning the house and abandoning the house, because they do not accept the knowledge of the saint, because they The siddhis obtained by their sacrifice and hatha yoga are proud and the pride of home renunciation also hinders the attainment of truth. Therefore, Karmayogi seeker is good against Shastra from Karmasanyasi without scripture. The same proof is said in the Gita chapter 18 verses 41 to 46 that a person of the four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatri, Vaishya and Shudra) also attain the ultimate Siddhi i.e. complete salvation while doing his natural deeds. It has been clarified about the supreme siddhi in the verse 46 that the divine God from whom all beings have originated from which this whole world is prevalent, the God gets the ultimate Siddhi by worshiping the God by his own natural deeds, that is. The truth seeker receives full salvation while doing karma. Chapter 18 Verse 47 has clarified that according to his scripture (performing karma), the one who performs spiritual practice against Shastra is superior. Because a seeker does not get sin doing his deeds. It also proved that it is a sin to persecute karma by retirement. In Shloka 48, it has been clarified that one should not abandon his natural deeds even if some sins are seen in it. Just as organisms die in cultivation etc. It is said about them that the practice told by me is my opinion. Which is both Amangal Kari and not doing it. Complete knowledge which is salvation is evidence in the Gita Chapter 4 Verse 33.34 from a metaphysical saint. The same proof is in the Gita Chapter 6 Verse 46, it is said that the Yogi is the best from the Karmayogi who does the practice against Shastra.।"

The temporary, incomparable (shantim) peace (richhati) attain (richhati) for which their supreme peace ends completely, i.e. the ability of peace, the ability to end, remains deprived of complete salvation, so my seeker also remains greatly sad. is the proof of the same in Gita Chapter 2 Verse 66 that the man without peace is happiness in Chapter 7 Verse 18 and in Gita Chapter 6 Verse The Purusha, that is, the Purusha, the giver of salvation, is any other, therefore, in Chapter 18 Verse 62.64.66, it is said that Arjuna, having taken refuge in that Supreme Being, will attain the supreme peace and eternal supreme abode, i.e. Satyaloka.\nSpecial : Because the time(Brahma) God (Brahma) of the three worlds Ma-Vishnu-Mahesh) is the master of the worlds of the Lords and the 21 universes. Therefore, God is also God. Therefore, the seeker is said to be Maheshwara and whatever the seeker obtains by performing Yajna or other Sadhana (tap) is the enjoyer (eaters) time. such as to be a king, to be happy, to distort various kinds of disorders. The joy of all these is the Lord Himself attains the mind form and then heats the hot rock and eats it with it. The ignorant creature is happy to know the compassionate and lover of the same time as the Lord. Like the goat's goat's governance (Kasai) see that he puts away, drinks water, protects from hot pool. Therefore, he considers him to be kind and loving but in fact that Kasai is time. Everyone will cut, kill and will prove selfishness. Such a time is shown to the Lord, but all beings eat. That is why it is said that I am the one who is cultivated by considering Me as the omniscient. Their peace is completed, that is, great troubles. In Gita Chapter 11 Verse 32, the Lord of the Gita, the giver of knowledge, is saying that I am time. I came to eat everything.

When the meaning of anuttama is very good in the compound, the meaning of the compound is superior in the compound. Other Gita Translations have done correct meaning by the meaning of Anuttam.\nAnswer:- I pray to you as true and I pray to you that “Gita Knowledge Giver about Gita Chapter 7 Verse from 18 is telling. If Gita Chapter 7 verse 18 are saying their practice and movement. The meaning of which is according to your compound that there is no other path by the movement of the Gita knowledge, i.e., the giver of the Gita, the giver of knowledge, the giver of knowledge himself, Gita Chapter 18, Verse 62 and Chapter 15, in the shelter of any other God. They are saying. By His grace, the supreme peace and eternal place, the ever-living place, the place of salvation, i.e., the Satyaloka, will be attained. It is also said in myself that I also take refuge in him. The same perfect God should be devoted and said that after attaining that God's Parampad (Satyaloka), after going where the seeker never comes in this world, that is, his birth and death always end. The Gita Chapter 18 Verses 46, 61- 62, 66 Chapter 15 Verse 4,16-17, Chapter 13 Verses 12 to 17 to 22 to 24, 27-28, 30-31, Chapter 5 Verse 6-10,13 to 21 and 24-25-26 Chapter 6 Verse 7,19, 20, 25, 26-27 Chapter 4 Verse 31-32, Chapter 8 Verse 3, 8 to 10, 17 to 22, Chapter 7 Verses 19 to 29, Chapter 14 Verse 19 etc. are stated in the 2 verses. This proves that the best of the Gita is the best, that is, the best God, as in Gita Chapter 15 Verse Therefore, that excellent person, that is, the best God, that is, the salvation that is found from it, also became very excellent. This also proved that that God, that is, the Supreme Being, the movement of the Gita, the giver of knowledge, became the best. Therefore, the Gita knowledge giver with knowledge is not the best. That is, there is no one who is superior. This adjective also proves in mistake. Because when there is no one and God better than the giver of the Gita, the movement of the Gita is better than the giver of the Gita. This proves that in Gita Chapter 7 Verse You and other Gita translations have misused meaning. What is the meaning of the unique and the best is done and done।"

The wise person is not deluded by the benefits of liberation from both the Lords, that is, he does not deceive by worshiping time. Therefore, it is said that the mind of devotion to that perfect God is made.

Some of you are stirring in the woods, it is said in verse 54. This means that my seekers attain Me. My own nets are staying. For that, Gita Chapter 8 Verse 28 says that the seeker does not destroy the fruit described in the Vedas from the path of devotion to the Purna Saints (Tattvadarshi Saints) but does not go to heaven etc. but uses to get the perfect God. The Vedas with that Vedas (om Naam) renounce the fruit of the five sacrifices) and attain the perfect God in Brahman for which cause complete salvation. This is the proof of this proof Gita Chapter 18 verse 66 that, O Arjuna, all the religious worships of my session have abandoned me and take refuge in that one (unique) omnipotent Supreme Being. Then I will free you from all sins. Because the debt of time eliminates the debt of time by leaving all the merits and chanting of the name of the person who had to enjoy the sins of those who had to enjoy the sins. Therefore, liberation from the network is obtained।"

The same is true of the proof of this Gita Chapter 7 Verse 24-25 and in Gita Chapter 8 Verse 20 to They do not believe in me, because of their jidds, I am the Lord of all Lords and Krishna. If any philosopher will explain the perfect God of the saint and Sri Krishna does not speak the Gita and this is not (time) Maheshwara. They do not believe in fools.\nSpecial:-- Gita 9 verse 11 has translation by another translator. It is not justified by the word ''Mam'' with the ''Bhoot Maheshwaram'', other translators have made the Gita Knowledge giver the great God of all beings. If the reader is considered to be the same, the meaning of this is that the Brahman is saying that I am the great God of all living beings of my twenty-one universes, that is, the chief. In fact, the above translation which is done by Mujh Das. That’s reality।"
